This project is a Java framework and library for automated testing.  It provides functionality to enable testing of web-based applications (using selenium http://seleniumhq.org/ ), GNOME apps (using LDTP), and console applications.  

TestNG ( http://testng.org ) is used as the test harness.  There are several plugins available here for TestNG to facilitate logging, screenshots, and interactions with Bugzilla and TCMS.  

Running tests under Hudson is also supported.

FAQ:

1) How do I run tests under hudson?
   Add a groovy task to you job that runs groovy/src/hudson.groovy.  The script takes a TestNG suite file argument, and an optional name of a test to run from within that suite.  If no test is specified, the whole suite is run.  

2) How do I get pretty reports in Hudson?
   Several java properties should be set in your hudson groovy task:
   	   -Dtestng.outputdir=[any relative path within the workspace - must be on the list of dirs to archive for the hudson job]
	   -Dselenium.screenshot.dir=[any subdir of the outputdir]
	   -Dselenium.screenshot.link.path=../artifact/[screenshotdir]

   Also, install the HTML Reports plugin for hudson.  In the Post-build actions for your hudson job, point the "Publish HTML Reports" section to the [outputdir]/html/index.html file that will be produced by the TestNG report.

   The report will use icons that need to be present on hudson.  Typically the hudson war dir is ~hudson/.hudson/war.  Create a subdir images/webui-framework under the war dir.  Copy the files web/*.png from this repository into images/webui-framework.  Then the report's icons will link to the correct files.
